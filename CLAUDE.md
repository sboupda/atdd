# =============================================================================
# ATDD AGENT BOOTSTRAP PROTOCOL (REQUIRED)
# =============================================================================
#
# Problem: Agents often skip instruction files and work without ATDD context.
# Solution: Coercive context - inject rules via mandatory tool output.
#
# PROTOCOL:
# ---------
# 0. TOOL GATE (MANDATORY)
#    If your agent supports plan mode (Claude Code, etc.), enable it NOW.
#    This is a tool capability gate, NOT the ATDD Planner phase.
#    If unavailable, state: "Plan mode unavailable" and proceed.
#
# 1. Run this command FIRST:
#
#    atdd gate
#
# 2. Paste the output and confirm:
#    - Which file(s) were loaded
#    - The reported hash
#    - The key ATDD constraints
#
# 3. If output shows missing/unsynced files, run:
#
#    atdd sync
#
#    Then re-run: atdd gate
#
# WHY THIS WORKS:
# - Gate output is mandatory tool output - agent can't ignore it
# - Proves which ATDD files were actually loaded
# - Forces consistency across all agents
#
# FAILURE MODE:
# - If agent skips the gate: STOP and run atdd gate again
# - Don't proceed until gate confirmation is posted
#
# RULE: If ATDD rules matter, start with `atdd gate`. No gate = no guarantees.

validations:

  code_quality:
    - "Domain layer has no external dependencies"
    - "All tests pass before REFACTOR"
    - "Architecture follows 4-layer pattern"
    - "Wagons isolated via qualified imports"
    - "Composition roots stable during refactor"
