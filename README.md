# ATDD

Acceptance Test Driven Development toolkit for structured planning and convention enforcement.

ATDD covers the full software lifecycle, not just code. It starts from a job to be done (e.g., user problem or goal), turns it into deterministic requirements, validates them with tests, and then drives implementation.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install atdd
```

### Upgrade

```bash
pip install --upgrade atdd
```

### Uninstall (Consumer Repos)

If you want to remove ATDD entirely:

1. Uninstall the package:
   ```bash
   python -m pip uninstall atdd
   ```
2. Manually delete ATDD artifacts in the repo:
   ```text
   .atdd/
   Managed blocks in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.
   ```

Uninstalling ATDD does not remove or revert any repo files.

### For Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afokapu/atdd.git
cd atdd
pip install -e ".[dev]"
atdd --help
```

## Quick Start

```bash
atdd init                      # Initialize ATDD + GitHub infrastructure
atdd gate                      # START EVERY SESSION WITH THIS
atdd new <slug>                # Create GitHub issue + WMBT sub-issues
atdd sync                      # Sync rules to agent config files
atdd validate                  # Run all validators
```

> **`atdd gate` is required.**
> Tell your agent: "Run `atdd gate` and follow ATDD rigorously."
> Agents skip instruction files but can't ignore tool output. No gate = no guarantees.

## What It Does

ATDD provides:

1. **Issue Tracking** - GitHub Issues + Project v2 custom fields as source of truth
2. **Convention Enforcement** - YAML-based conventions validated via pytest
3. **ATDD Lifecycle** - Planner → Tester → Coder phase gates with state machine transitions
4. **Agent Config Sync** - Keep ATDD rules in sync across AI agent config files
5. **Design System Compliance** - Hierarchy, token, and adoption validators for frontend

## Commands

### Project Initialization

```bash
atdd init              # Bootstrap .atdd/, GitHub labels, Project v2 fields, CLAUDE.md
atdd init --force      # Reinitialize (overwrites existing)
```

Creates:
```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md              # With managed ATDD block
└── .atdd/
    ├── manifest.yaml      # Issue tracking
    └── config.yaml        # Agent sync + release configuration
```

Also sets up on GitHub:
- Labels: `atdd-issue`, `atdd-wmbt`, `atdd:RED`, `atdd:GREEN`, `atdd:REFACTOR`, archetype labels
- Project v2 custom fields: `ATDD:Status`, `ATDD:Train`, `ATDD:Archetypes`, etc.

### Worktree Layout

Migrate your repo to a flat-sibling worktree layout where each branch lives alongside `main/`:

```bash
atdd init --worktree-layout         # Migrate repo into main/ subdirectory
atdd init --worktree-layout --force # Non-interactive
```

Resulting structure:
```
your-project/
├── your-project.code-workspace   # VS Code multi-root workspace (auto-generated)
├── main/                         # Primary checkout
├── feat-some-feature/            # git worktree: feat/some-feature
└── fix-login-bug/                # git worktree: fix/login-bug
```

Creating and removing worktrees:
```bash
cd main
git worktree add ../feat-my-feature -b feat/my-feature   # New branch
git worktree remove ../feat-my-feature                    # After merge
```

After adding or removing worktrees, run `atdd sync` to refresh the workspace file:
```bash
atdd sync   # Regenerates .code-workspace with current worktrees
```

#### Opening the Workspace

After migrating to worktree layout, **always open the `.code-workspace` file** instead of individual folders:

```bash
code your-project.code-workspace   # or: File → Open Workspace from File…
```

This gives you:
- **Branch-aware sidebar** — each worktree folder shows its active branch in the Explorer
- **Git tracking per worktree** — Source Control panel tracks changes independently per branch
- **Shared settings** — editor config, extensions, and tasks apply across all worktrees
- **Auto-updated** — `atdd sync` regenerates the workspace file when worktrees are added or removed

> **Do not open `main/` directly.** Without the workspace file, VS Code won't track sibling worktrees and you lose multi-branch visibility.

### Issue Management

Issues are the source of truth, backed by GitHub Issues with Project v2 custom fields.

```bash
atdd new <slug>                              # Create parent issue + WMBT sub-issues
atdd new <slug> --archetypes be,contracts    # Specify archetypes
atdd new <slug> --train <id>                 # Assign to train
atdd list                                    # List all issues
atdd update <N> --status <STATUS>            # Update status (swaps labels automatically)
atdd update <N> --status COMPLETE --train <id>  # COMPLETE runs gate tests, artifact + release verification
atdd update <N> --status COMPLETE --force   # Bypass gate/artifact/release checks (train still enforced)
atdd close-wmbt <N> <WMBT_ID>               # Close a WMBT sub-issue
atdd archive <N>                             # Close parent + all sub-issues
```

**State machine transitions:**
```
INIT → PLANNED → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → COMPLETE
         ↕         ↕      ↕        ↕
       BLOCKED   BLOCKED BLOCKED  BLOCKED → OBSOLETE
```

**Archetypes:** `db`, `be`, `fe`, `contracts`, `wmbt`, `wagon`, `train`, `telemetry`, `migrations`

Each archetype includes gate tests in the issue template (e.g., `fe` issues get GT-020 for TypeScript architecture and GT-021 for design system compliance).

### Agent Config Sync

Sync ATDD rules to agent config files using managed blocks that preserve user content:

```bash
atdd sync                  # Sync all enabled agents from config
atdd sync --agent claude   # Sync specific agent only
atdd sync --verify         # Check if files are in sync (for CI)
atdd sync --status         # Show sync status for all agents
```

Supported agents:
| Agent | File |
|-------|------|
| claude | CLAUDE.md |
| codex | AGENTS.md |
| gemini | GEMINI.md |
| qwen | QWEN.md |

Configure which agents to sync in `.atdd/config.yaml`:
```yaml
version: "1.0"
sync:
  agents:
    - claude      # Enabled by default
    # - codex     # Uncomment to sync AGENTS.md
    # - gemini    # Uncomment to sync GEMINI.md
    # - qwen      # Uncomment to sync QWEN.md
```

### ATDD Gate (Bootstrap Protocol)

Agents often skip instruction files. The gate solves this by injecting rules via mandatory tool output.

```bash
atdd gate              # Show gate verification info
atdd gate --json       # Output as JSON
```

**Protocol:**
1. Run `atdd gate` first
2. Agent must confirm: which files were loaded, the reported hash, key constraints
3. If files are missing/unsynced: run `atdd sync` then `atdd gate` again

**Why this works:** Gate output is mandatory tool output — agent can't ignore it. Proves which ATDD files were actually loaded and forces consistency across all agents.

### Validation

Four validator phases matching the ATDD lifecycle:

```bash
atdd validate              # Run all validators (two-stage: fast then platform)
atdd validate planner      # Planning validators (wagons, trains, URNs, WMBTs)
atdd validate tester       # Testing validators (contracts, telemetry, test naming)
atdd validate coder        # Implementation validators (architecture, boundaries, design system)
atdd validate coach        # Coach validators (issues, registries, release, gate completion)
atdd validate --quick      # Fast smoke test
atdd validate --no-split   # Single-pass execution (skip two-stage split)
atdd validate --coverage   # With coverage report
atdd validate --html       # With HTML report
```

By default, `atdd validate` runs in two stages: fast file-parsing tests in parallel, then API-bound platform tests sequentially with shared session fixtures.

### Release Versioning

ATDD enforces release versioning via coach validators. Configure the version file and tag prefix in `.atdd/config.yaml`:

```yaml
release:
  version_file: "pyproject.toml"   # or package.json, VERSION, etc.
  tag_prefix: "v"
```

Validation (`atdd validate coach`) requires:
- Version file exists and contains a version
- Git tag on HEAD matches `{tag_prefix}{version}`

### CI Release Workflow

`atdd init` generates two GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `atdd-validate.yml` | push, PR, issues | Run ATDD validators |
| `publish.yml` | `workflow_run` (after validate succeeds on main) | Tag + publish |

**Release flow:**
1. Agent bumps version on PR branch (feat/ → MINOR, fix/ → PATCH)
2. PR merges to main
3. `atdd-validate.yml` runs validators
4. `publish.yml` triggers automatically: reads version → creates git tag → publishes

**Consumer repos** get tag creation out of the box. To add platform-specific publishing (PyPI, npm, Docker), extend the generated `publish.yml` with your own publish steps. See the [atdd toolkit's publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml) as a PyPI example.

### URN Graph UI

Visualize URN traceability as an interactive graph with search, family filters, and node inspection.

```bash
pip install atdd[viz]
atdd urn viz                           # Launch on default port 8502
atdd urn viz --port 9000               # Custom port
atdd urn viz --root wagon:my-wagon     # Subgraph from root
atdd urn viz --family wagon --family feature  # Filter families
```

### Other Commands

```bash
atdd status                    # Platform status
atdd inventory                 # Generate artifact inventory
atdd inventory --format json   # Inventory as JSON
atdd registry update           # Update all registries
atdd --help                    # Full help
```
