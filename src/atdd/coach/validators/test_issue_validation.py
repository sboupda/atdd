"""
Issue validation against GitHub Issues and Project v2 fields.

Purpose: Validate GitHub Issues before implementation starts.
Convention: src/atdd/coach/conventions/issue.convention.yaml

E008: Train enforcement validators (SPEC-SESSION-VAL-0050 to 0051):
- Issues must have a non-empty Train field after PLANNED phase
- Train field must reference a valid train_id from _trains.yaml

E010: Body section validator (SPEC-SESSION-VAL-0060):
- Issues should have all 11 structured sections from PARENT-ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md
- Soft check (warning) for pre-E010 issues

E011: Branch naming validator (SPEC-SESSION-VAL-0070):
- Issues past PLANNED must have a Branch field matching an allowed prefix
- Branch = worktree (every branch is created as a git worktree)

E012: Manifest consistency validator (SPEC-SESSION-VAL-0080):
- Every open GitHub issue with atdd-issue label must have a corresponding
  entry in .atdd/manifest.yaml
- Detects issues created directly via `gh issue create` or the GitHub UI
  instead of through `atdd issue <slug>`

Run: atdd validate coach
