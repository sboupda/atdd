URN Traceability Validators
===========================
Coach validators for URN coverage, resolution, and traceability.

Validates:
- All contract schemas have producing wagon reference
- All contract: URNs in produce[] resolve to files
- All URN resolutions are deterministic
- All required traceability edges exist per spec Section 8

Phase 1 (warn): Reports issues as warnings
Phase 2 (fail): Reports issues as errors, fails CI
