# =============================================================================
# ATDD AGENT BOOTSTRAP PROTOCOL (REQUIRED)
# =============================================================================
#
# Problem: Agents often skip instruction files and work without ATDD context.
# Solution: Coercive context - inject rules via mandatory tool output.
#
# PROTOCOL:
# ---------
# 0. TOOL GATE (MANDATORY)
#    If your agent supports plan mode (Claude Code, etc.), enable it NOW.
#    This is a tool capability gate, NOT the ATDD Planner phase.
#    If unavailable, state: "Plan mode unavailable" and proceed.
#
# 1. Run this command FIRST:
#
#    atdd gate
#
# 2. Paste the output and confirm:
#    - Which file(s) were loaded
#    - The reported hash
#    - The key ATDD constraints
#
# 3. If output shows missing/unsynced files, run:
#
#    atdd sync
#
#    Then re-run: atdd gate
#
# WHY THIS WORKS:
# - Gate output is mandatory tool output - agent can't ignore it
# - Proves which ATDD files were actually loaded
# - Forces consistency across all agents
#
# FAILURE MODE:
# - If agent skips the gate: STOP and run atdd gate again
# - Don't proceed until gate confirmation is posted
#
# RULE: If ATDD rules matter, start with `atdd gate`. No gate = no guarantees.

# Git Practices
git:
  commits:
    co_authored: false  # DO NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
    format: "conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:)"
    atomic: "One commit per phase transition when meaningful"

  # ─── MICRO-COMMIT DISCIPLINE (MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS) ───────────────
  # Agents MUST commit frequently to avoid losing work.
  # Large uncommitted deltas are the #1 cause of lost agent work
  # (incident: 64 files edited on main, all lost when pre-commit hook blocked).
  #
  # Rules:
  #   1. Commit after EVERY completed sub-task (file created, test written, bug fixed).
  #   2. Never accumulate more than 5 modified files without committing.
  #   3. If you realize you are on main: STOP editing immediately.
  #      Recovery: git stash → atdd branch <N> → cd worktree → git stash pop
  #   4. Prefer many small commits over one large commit — they are easier to
  #      review, revert, and bisect.
  #   5. A commit message can be short ("add CameoRepository") — frequency
  #      matters more than message polish during active development.
  #
  # Anti-patterns (NEVER do these):
  #   - Edit 10+ files then commit once at the end
  #   - Defer commits until "everything works"
  #   - Batch unrelated changes in one commit
  # ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
