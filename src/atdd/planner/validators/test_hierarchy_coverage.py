Planner hierarchy coverage validation.

ATDD Hierarchy Coverage Spec v0.1 - Section 2: Planner Coverage Rules

Validates bidirectional coverage between:
- Trains <-> Wagons (COVERAGE-PLAN-2.1)
- Wagons <-> Features (COVERAGE-PLAN-2.2)
- Features <-> WMBTs (COVERAGE-PLAN-2.3)
- WMBTs <-> Acceptances (COVERAGE-PLAN-2.4)

Architecture:
- Uses shared fixtures from atdd.coach.validators.shared_fixtures
- Phased rollout via atdd.coach.utils.coverage_phase
- Exception handling via .atdd/config.yaml coverage.exceptions
